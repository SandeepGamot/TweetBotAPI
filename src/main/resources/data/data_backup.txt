  
1.1 
Master, 
how is Knowledge to be achieved, 
detachment acquired, 
liberation attained?<br>
 

1.2 
To be free, 
shun the experiences of the senses 
like poison. 
Turn your attention to 
forgiveness, sincerity, kindness, simplicity, truth.<br>
 
1.3 
You are not earth, water, fire or air. 
Nor are you empty space. 
Liberation is to know yourself 
as Awareness alone— 
the Witness of these.<br>
 
1.4  
Abide in Awareness 
with no illusion of person. 
You will be instantly free and at peace.<br>
 
1.5 
You have no caste or duties. 
You are invisible, unattached, formless. 
You are the Witness of all things. 
Be happy.<br>
 
1.6 
Right and wrong, pleasure and pain, 
exist in mind only. 
They are not your concern. 
You neither do nor enjoy. 
You are free.<br>
 
1.7 
You are the Solitary Witness 
of All That Is,  
forever free. 
Your only bondage is not seeing This.<br>
 
1.8 
The thought: “I am the doer” 
is the bite of a poisonous snake. 
To know: “I do nothing” 
is the wisdom of faith. 
Be happy.<br>
 
1.9 
A single understanding: 
“I am the One Awareness,” 
consumes all suffering 
in the fire of an instant. 
Be happy.<br>
 
1.10 
You are unbounded Awareness— 
Bliss, Supreme Bliss-- 
in which the universe appears 
like the mirage of a snake in a rope. 
Be happy.<br>
 
1.11 
 It is true what they say: 
“You are what you think.” 
If you think you are bound you are bound. 
If you think you are free you are free.<br>
 
1.12 
You are Self—the Solitary Witness. 
You are perfect, all-pervading, One. 
You are free, desireless,  forever still. 
The universe is but a seeming in You.<br>
 
1.13 
Meditate on this: “I am Awareness alone--Unity itself.”  
Give up the idea that you are separate, a person, 
that there is within and without.<br>
 
1.14 
You have long been bound thinking: 
“I am a person.” 
Let the knowledge: “I am Awareness alone” 
be the sword that frees you.<br>
 
1.15 
You are now and forever 
free, luminous, transparent, still. 
The practice of meditation 
keeps one in bondage.<br>
 
1.16 
You are pure Consciousness— 
the substance of the universe. 
The universe exists within you. 
Don’t be small-minded.<br>
 
1.17 
You are unconditioned, changeless, formless. 
You are solid, unfathomable, cool.  
Desire nothing. 
You are Consciousness.<br>
 
1.18 
That which has form is not real. 
Only the formless is permanent.  
Once this is known, 
you will not return to illusion.<br>
 
1.19 
Just as a mirror exists 
both within and without 
the image reflected, 
the Supreme Self exists 
both within and without the body.<br>
 
1.20 
Just as the same space exists 
both within and without a jar, 
the timeless, all-pervasive One 
exists as Totality.<br>

2.1 
I am now spotless and at peace-- 
Awareness beyond Consciousness. 
All this time 
I have been duped by illusion.<br>
 
2.2 
By this light alone 
the body and the universe appear. 
I am Everything 
or Nothing.<br>
 
2.3 
Seeing there is no 
universe or body, 
by grace the Self is revealed.<br>
 
2.4 
As waves, foam and bubbles 
are not different from water,    
so the universe emanating from Self 
is not different from Self.<br>
 
2.5 
Look closely at cloth, 
you see only threads. 
Look closely at creation, 
you see only Self.<br>
 
2.6 
As sweetness 
pervades sugarcane juice, 
I am the essence of creation.<br>
 
2.7 
Not seeing Self, the world is materialized. 
Seeing Self, the world is vanished. 
A rope is not a snake, 
but can appear to be.<br>
 
2.8 
I am not other than Light. 
The universe manifests 
at my glance.<br>
 
2.9 
The mirage of universe appears in me 
as silver appears in mother-of-pearl, 
as a snake appears in a rope, 
as water appears on a desert horizon.<br>
 
2.10 
As a pot returns to clay, 
a wave to water, 
a bracelet to gold,  
so will the universe return to Me.<br>
 
2.11 
I am wonderful indeed-- 
beyond adoration. 
I cannot decay nor ever die,  
though God and all the universe 
should perish to the last blade of grass.<br>
 
2.12 
I am wonderful indeed-- 
beyond adoration. 
Even with a body I am One. 
I neither come nor go. 
I am everywhere at once.<br>
 
2.13 
I am wonderful indeed-- 
beyond adoration. 
I am astounded at my powers. 
The universe appears within me 
but I do not touch it.<br>
 
2.14 
I am wonderful indeed-- 
beyond adoration. 
I am everything thought or spoken, 
and have nothing.<br>
 
2.15 
In Reality, 
knowledge, the knower, and the knowable 
do not exist.  
I am the transparent Self 
in which through ignorance 
they appear.<br>
 
2.16 
Looking at One and seeing many 
is the cause of all misery. 
The only cure is to realize  
what is seen is not there. 
I am One—aware, blissful, immaculate.<br>
 
2.17 
I am unbounded Awareness. 
Only in imagination do I have limits. 
Reflecting on this, 
I abide in the Absolute.<br>
 
2.18 
I am neither free nor bound. 
The illusion of such things 
has fallen into disbelief. 
Though I contain creation, 
it has no substance.<br>
 
2.19 
Having seen for certain 
that this universe and body 
is without form or substance, 
I am revealed as Awareness alone. 
Imagination has no place here.<br>
 
 
2.20 
The body exists only in imagination, 
as do heaven and hell, 
bondage, freedom, fear. 
Are these my concern? 
I, who am pure Awareness?<br>
 
2.21 
I see no differences or separation. 
Even the multitudes appear 
as a single formless desert. 
To what should I cling?<br>
 
2.22 
I am not the body. 
I do not have a body. 
I am Awareness, not a person. 
My thirst for life bound me 
to a seeming of life.<br>
 
2.23 
In the limitless ocean of Myself 
the winds of the mind 
roil the myriad waves of the world.<br>
 
2.24 
But when the wind subsides 
in the limitless ocean 
the ark of personhood is swallowed up, 
along with the universe it carries.<br>
 
2.25 
And how wonderful it is! 
In the limitless ocean of Myself, 
waves of beings 
arise, collide, play for a time, 
then disappear--as is their nature.<br> 
 
3.1 
Having realized yourself as One, 
being serene and indestructible, 
why do you desire wealth?<br>
 
3.2 
Just as imagining silver in mother-of-pearl, 
causes greed to arise, 
so does ignorance of Self 
cause desire for illusion.<br>
 
3.3 
Having realized yourself as That 
in which the waves of the world rise and fall, 
why do you run around in turmoil?<br>
 
3.4 
Having realized yourself as pure Awareness, 
as beautiful beyond description, 
how can you remain a slave to lust?<br>
 
3.5 
It is strange 
that in a sage who has realized  
Self in All and All in Self 
this sense of ownership should continue.<br>
 
3.6 
Strange that one abiding in the Absolute, 
intent on freedom, 
should be vulnerable to lust 
and weakened by amorous pastimes.<br>
 
3.7
Strange that knowing lust 
as an enemy of knowledge, 
one so weak and nearing death 
should still crave sensual pleasure.<br>
 
3.8 
Strange that one who is unattached 
to the things of this world and the next, 
who can discriminate between the transient and the timeless, 
who yearns for freedom, 
should yet fear the dissolution of the body.<br>
 
3.9 
Whether acclaimed or tormented 
the serene sage abides in the Self. 
He is neither gratified nor angered.<br>
 
3.10 
A great soul 
witnesses his body’s actions 
as if they were another’s. 
How can praise or blame disturb him?<br>
 
3.11 
Realizing the universe is illusion, 
having lost all curiosity, 
how can one of steady mind fear death?<br>
 
3.12 
With whom can we compare 
the great soul 
who, content knowing Self, 
remains desireless in disappointment?<br>
 
3.13 
Why should a person of steady mind, 
who sees the nothingness of objects, 
prefer one thing to another?<br>
 
3.14 
He who is unattached, 
untouched by opposites, 
free of desire, 
experiences neither pleasure nor pain 
as events pass through.<br>

 
4.1 
Surely one who knows Self, 
though he plays the game of life, 
differs greatly from the world’s 
bewildered burdened beasts.<br>
 
4.2 
Truly the yogi feels no elation, 
though he abides in the exalted state 
yearned for by Indra and all the 
discontented gods.<br>
 
4.3 
Surely one who knows That 
is not touched by virtue or vice, 
just as space is not touched by smoke, 
though it seems to be.<br>
 
4.4 
Who can prevent the great soul, 
who knows the universe as Self, 
from living life as it comes?<br>
 
4.5 
Of the four kinds of beings, 
from Brahma to a blade of grass, 
only the sage can renounce 
aversion and desire.<br>
 
4.6 
Rare is he who knows himself 
as One with no other— 
the Lord of the Universe. 
He acts as he knows 
and is never afraid.<br>
 

5.1 
You are immaculate, 
touched by nothing. 
What is there to renounce? 
The mind is complex—let it go. 
Know the peace of dissolution.<br>
 
5.2 
The universe arises from you 
like foam from the sea. 
Know yourself as One. 
Enter the peace of dissolution.<br>
 
5.3 
Like an imagined snake in a rope 
the universe appears to exist 
in the immaculate Self 
but does not.  
Seeing this you know: “There is nothing to dissolve.”<br>
 
5.4 
You are perfect, changeless, 
through misery and happiness, 
hope and despair, 
life and death. 
This is the state of dissolution.<br> 

  

6.1 
I am infinite space; 
the universe is a jar. 
This I know. 
No need to renounce, accept or destroy.<br>
 
6.2 
I am a shoreless ocean; 
the universe makes waves. 
This I know. 
No need to renounce, accept or destroy.<br>
 
6.3 
I am mother-of–pearl; 
the universe is the illusion of silver. 
This I know. 
No need to renounce, accept or destroy.<br>
 
6.4 
I am in all beings; 
all beings are in me. 
This I know. 
No need to renounce, accept or destroy.<br>


 

7.1 
In me, the shoreless ocean, 
the ark of universe 
drifts here and there 
on the winds of its nature. 
I am not impatient.<br>
 
7.2 
In me, the shoreless ocean, 
let the waves of the universe 
rise and fall as they will. 
I am neither enhanced nor diminished.<br>
 
7.3 
In me, the shoreless ocean, 
the universe is imagined. 
I am still and formless. 
In this alone I abide.<br>
 
7.4 
The Self is not in objects, 
nor are objects in the pure and infinite Self. 
The Self is tranquil, 
free of attachment and desire. 
In this alone I abide.<br>
 
7.5 
I am Awareness alone. 
The world is passing show. 
How can thoughts arise 
of acceptance or rejection? 
And where?<br> 
 

8.1 
When the mind desires or grieves things, 
accepts or rejects things, 
is pleased or displeased by things-- 
this is bondage.<br>
 
8.2 
When the mind does not 
desire or grieve, 
accept or reject, 
become pleased or displeased, 
liberation is at hand.<br>
 
8.3 
If the mind is attached to any experience, 
this is bondage. 
When the mind is detached from all experience, 
this is liberation.<br>
 
8.4 
When there is no “I” 
there is only liberation. 
When “I” appears 
bondage appears with it. 
Knowing this, 
it is effortless to refrain 
from accepting and rejecting.<br>


 
 

9.1 
Opposing forces, 
duties done and left undone— 
when does it end 
and for whom? 
Considering this, be ever desireless, 
let go of all things, 
and to the world turn an indifferent eye.<br>
 
9.2 
Rare and blessed is one 
whose desire to live, 
to enjoy and to know, 
has been extinguished by observing 
the ways of men.<br>
 
9.3 
Seeing all things as threefold suffering, 
the sage becomes still. 
Insubstantial, transient, contemptible-- 
the world is fit only for rejection.<br>
 
9.4 
Was there an age or time 
men existed without opposites? 
Leave the opposites behind. 
Be content with what comes. 
Perfection.<br>
 
9.5 
The greatest seers, saints and yogis 
agree on very little. 
Seeing this, 
who could not be indifferent to knowledge  
and become still?<br>
 
9.6 
One who 
through worldly indifference, 
through serenity and reason, 
sees his true nature and escapes illusion— 
is he not a true teacher?<br>
 
9.7 
In the myriad forms of the universe 
see the primal element alone. 
You will be instantly free, 
and abide in Self.<br>
 
9.8 
Desire creates the world--renounce it. 
Renounce desires 
and you renounce the world. 
Now you may live as you are.<br>


 
 

10.1 
Give up desire, 
which is the enemy. 
Give up prosperity, 
which is born of mischief and good works. 
Be indifferent.<br>
 
10.2 
Look upon  
friends, lands, wealth, houses, wives, gifts-- 
and all apparent good fortune-- 
as a passing show, 
as a dream lasting three to five days.<br>
 
10.3 
Where there is desire, there is the world. 
Be firm in non-attachment. 
Be free of desire. 
Be happy.<br>
 
10.4 
Bondage and desire are the same. 
Destroy desire and be free. 
Only by detaching from the world 
does one joyfully realize Self.<br>
 
10.5 
You are One— 
Awareness itself. 
The universe is neither aware 
nor does it exist. 
Even ignorance is unreal. 
What is left to know?<br>
 
10.6 
Attached as you have been to 
kingdoms, sons, wives, bodies, pleasures— 
life after life— 
still they are now lost forever.<br>
 
10.7 
Prosperity, pleasure, pious deeds… 
Enough! 
In the dreary forest of the world 
the mind finds no rest.<br>
 
10.8 
For how many lifetimes 
have you done hard and painful labor 
with body, mind and speech? 
It is time to stop.<br>


 
 

11.1 
Existence, non-existence, change-- 
this is the nature of things. 
Realizing this, 
stillness, serenity and bliss 
naturally follow.<br>
 
11.2 
One who knows for certain that 
“Self creates All and is alone” 
becomes still, desireless, unattached.<br>
 
11.3 
One who knows for certain 
that adversity and success 
come and go in obedience to destiny 
becomes content. 
He neither desires nor grieves.<br>
 
11.4 
One who knows for certain 
that birth and death, happiness and misery, 
come and go in obedience to destiny 
sees nothing to accomplish. 
He engages in non-action, 
and in action remains unattached.<br>
 
11.5 
One who has realized 
that only by caring 
is misery caused in the world 
becomes free, happy, serene, desireless.<br>
 
11.6 
“I am not the body, nor is the body my possession— 
I am Awareness itself.” 
One who realizes this for certain 
has no memory of things done or left undone. 
There is only the Absolute.<br>
 
11.7 
“From Brahma to the last blade of grass-- 
I alone exist.” 
One who knows this for certain 
becomes immaculate, serene, unconflicted. 
Attainment has no meaning.<br>
 
11.8 
One who knows for certain 
that this manifold and wonderful universe 
is nothing 
becomes desireless Awareness 
and abides in the stillness of No-thing.<br>
 

 
 

12.1 
Becoming first intolerant of action, 
then of excessive speech, 
then of thought itself, 
I come to be here.<br>
 
12.2 
Neither sounds nor other sense perceptions  
attract my attention. 
Even the Self is unperceived. 
The mind is free, undistracted, one-pointed. 
And here I am.<br>
 
12.3 
Effort is required 
to concentrate a distracted mind 
superimposed with illusion. 
Knowing this, I remain here.<br>
 
12.4 
Nothing to reject, 
nothing to accept. 
No joy, no sorrow. 
Lord God I am here.<br>
 
12.5 
The four stages of life, 
life without stages, 
meditation, renunciation, objects of mind— 
nothing but distractions. 
I am forever here.<br>
 
12.6 
Doing and not-doing 
both arise from ignorance. 
I know this. 
And I am here.<br>
 
12.7 
Thinking of the unthinkable One 
unavoidably conjures thought. 
I choose no-thought 
and remain here.<br>
 
12.8 
Blessed is he 
who attains this by effort. 
Blessed is he 
who is such by nature.<br>

 
 

13.1 
The tranquil state 
of knowing Self alone is rare— 
even among those who own but a loincloth. 
I therefore neither renounce nor accept 
and am happy.<br>
 
13.2 
The body is strained by practices. 
The tongue tires of scripture. 
The mind numbs with meditation. 
Detached from all this, 
I live as I am.<br>
 
13.3 
Realizing that nothing is done, 
I do what comes 
and am happy.<br>
 
13.4 
Yogis who preach 
either effort or non-effort 
are still attached to the body. 
I neither dissociate nor associate 
with any of that 
and am happy.<br>
 
13.5 
I have nothing to gain or lose 
by standing, walking or sitting down. 
So whether I stand, walk or sit 
I am happy.<br>
 
13.6 
I do not lose by sleeping 
nor attain by effort. 
Not thinking in terms of loss or gain 
I am happy.<br>
 
13.7 
Pleasure and pain fluctuate 
and are inconsistent. 
Without good or bad 
I live happily.<br>


 
 

14.1 
Though appearing asleep like other men, 
one whose interest in the world is exhausted, 
whose mind has been emptied, 
who thinks only by inadvertence, 
is in Reality awake.<br>
 
14.2 
When desire has melted, 
how can there be wealth, 
or friends, or the seduction of senses? 
What use is scripture and knowledge?<br>
 
14.3 
I have realized the Supreme Self, 
the Witness, the One. 
I am indifferent 
to bondage and freedom. 
I have no need for liberation.<br>
 
14.4 
The inner condition 
of one who is devoid of doubt 
yet moves among creatures of illusion 
can only be known by those like him.<br>


 
 

15.1 
A man of open intuition 
may realize the Self upon 
hearing a casual instruction, 
while a man of cluttered intellect 
inquires bewildered for a lifetime.<br>
 
15.2 
Aversion to the world’s offerings is liberation. 
Attraction to the world’s offerings 
is the suffering of bondage. 
This is the truth. 
Now do as you please.<br>
 
15.3 
This knowledge of Truth 
turns an eloquent, wise and active man 
mute, empty and inert. 
Lovers of the world therefore shun it.<br>
 
15.4 
You are not the body. 
You do not have a body. 
You neither do nor enjoy. 
You are Awareness only--the timeless Witness. 
You are free. 
Go in happiness.<br>
 
15.5 
Attachment and aversion 
are attributes of the mind. 
You are not the mind. 
You are Consciousness itself-- 
changeless, undivided, free. 
Go in happiness.<br>
 
15.6 
Realize Self in All and All in Self. 
Be free of personal identity 
and the sense of “mine.” 
Be happy.<br>
 
15.7 
You are That in which the universe appears 
like waves appearing in the ocean. 
You are Consciousness itself. 
No need to worry.<br>
 
15.8 
Have faith, my son, have faith. 
You are Awareness alone, 
the Self, the One. 
You are the Lord of Nature.<br>
 
15.9 
The body is made of worldly stuff. 
It comes, it lingers, it goes. 
The Self neither comes nor goes, 
yet remains. 
Why mourn the body?<br>
 
15.10 
If the body lasts until the end of time 
or perishes today— 
is there gain or loss for you? 
You who are Awareness?<br>
 
15.11 
Let the waves of the universe 
rise and fall as they will. 
You have nothing to gain or lose. 
You are the ocean.<br>
 
15.12 
You are the substance of Consciousness. 
The world is You. 
Who is it that thinks 
he can accept or reject it? 
And where does he stand?<br>
 
15.13 
In you who are One— 
immaculate, still Awareness— 
from where can birth, action 
or a separate person arise?<br>
 
15.14 
Whatever you perceive 
is You and You alone. 
How can bracelets, armlets and anklets 
be other than the gold they are made of?<br>
 
15.15 
Leave behind such distinctions 
as “I am He, the Self,” 
and “I am not this.” 
Consider everything Self. 
Be desireless. 
Be happy.<br>
 
15.16 
Your ignorance alone 
creates the universe. 
In reality One alone exists. 
There is no person or god 
other than You.<br>
 
15.17 
One who knows for certain 
that the universe is illusion, 
a no-thing, 
becomes desireless, 
pure Awareness, 
and finds peace in the existence of nothing.<br>
 
15.18 
In the ocean of existence 
only One is, was, and ever will be. 
You are neither bound nor free. 
Live content and be happy.<br>
  
15.19 
Do not stir the mind 
with “yes” or “no.” 
You are pure Consciousness. 
Be still, 
and abide in the bliss of Self.<br>
 
15.20 
Give up completely 
all contemplation. 
Hold nothing in the mind or heart. 
You are the Self, forever free. 
Of what use is thinking to you?<br> 
  

16.1 
You can recite and discuss scripture 
all you want, 
but until you drop everything 
you will never know Truth.<br>
 
16.2 
You can enjoy and work and meditate, 
but you will still yearn for That 
which is beyond all experience, 
and in which all desires are extinguished.<br>
 
16.3 
Everyone is miserable 
because they exert constant effort. 
But no one understands this. 
A ripe mind can become unshackled 
upon hearing this one instruction.<br>
 
16.4 
The master idler, 
to whom even blinking is a bother, 
is happy. 
But he is the only one.<br>
 
16.5 
When the mind is free of opposites 
like “This is done,” and “This is yet undone,” 
one becomes indifferent to 
merit, wealth, pleasure and liberation.<br>
 
16.6 
One who abhors sense objects avoids them. 
One who desires them becomes ensnared.  
One who neither abhors nor desires 
is neither detached nor attached.<br>

16.7 
As long as there is desire-- 
which is the absence of discrimination-- 
there will be attachment and non-attachment. 
This is the cause of the world.<br>
 
16.8 
Indulgence creates attachment. 
Aversion creates abstinence. 
Like a child, the sage is free of both 
and thus lives on as a child.<br>
 
16.9 
One who is attached to the world 
thinks renouncing it will relieve his misery. 
One who is attached to nothing is free 
and does not feel miserable 
even in the world.<br>
 
16.10 
He who claims liberation as his own, 
as an attainment of a person, 
is neither enlightened nor a seeker. 
He suffers his own misery.<br>
 
16.11 
Though Hara, Hari 
or the lotus-born Brahma himself 
instruct you, 
until you know nothing 
you will never know Self.<br>
  

17.1 
One has attained Knowledge 
and reaped the fruits of yoga 
who is content, 
purified of attachments 
and at home in solitude.<br>
 
17.2 
The knower of Truth 
is never miserable in the world, 
for the whole universe 
is filled with Himself alone.<br>
 
17.3 
As the foliage of the neem tree 
does not please an elephant 
who delights in sallaki leaves, 
so do sense objects not please 
he who delights in Self.<br>
 
17.4 
Rare in the world 
is one who does not  
relish past enjoyments, 
nor yearn for enjoyments to come.<br>
 
17.5 
Those who desire pleasure 
and those who desire liberation 
are both common in the world. 
Rare is the great soul who 
desires neither enjoyment 
nor liberation.<br>
 
17.6 
Rare is the right-minded person 
who neither covets nor shuns 
religion, wealth, pleasure, 
life or death.<br>
 
17.7 
The man of Knowledge 
neither cares for the universe 
nor desires its dissolution. 
He lives happily 
on whatever comes his way. 
He is blessed.<br>
 
17.8 
Knowing Self, 
mind empty and at peace, 
the sage lives happily, 
seeing, hearing, touching, smelling, eating.<br>
 
17.9 
There is no attachment or non-attachment 
for one in whom 
the ocean of the world has dried up. 
His look is vacant, 
senses still. 
His actions have no purpose.<br>
 
17.10 
The sage is neither asleep nor awake. 
He neither closes nor opens his eyes. 
Thus, for the liberated soul, 
everywhere there is only This.<br>
 
17.11 
The liberated soul 
abides in Self alone 
and is pure of heart. 
He lives always and everywhere, 
free of desire.<br>
 
17.12 
Seeing, hearing, touching, smelling, 
eating, taking, speaking, walking, 
the great soul 
exerts neither effort nor non-effort. 
He is truly free.<br>
 
17.13 
The liberated soul 
does not blame or praise, 
give or take, 
rejoice or become angry. 
He is everywhere unattached 
and free.<br>
 
17.14 
The great soul 
remains poised and undisturbed, 
whether in the presence 
of a passionate woman 
or observing the approach of his death. 
He is truly free.<br>
 
17.15 
The sage sees no difference 
between happiness and misery, 
man and woman, 
adversity and success. 
Everything is seen to be the same.<br>
 
17.16 
In the sage there is neither 
violence nor mercy, 
arrogance nor humility, 
anxiety nor wonder. 
His worldly life is exhausted. 
He has transcended his role as a person.<br>
  
17.17 
The liberated one 
neither avoids experience 
nor craves it. 
He enjoys what comes 
and what does not.<br>
 
17.18 
The sage is not conflicted 
by states of stillness and thought. 
His mind is empty. 
His home is the Absolute.<br>
 
17.19 
Though he may perform actions, 
the man of Knowledge 
does not act. 
Desires extinguished, 
free of thoughts of “I” and “mine,” 
he knows with absolute certainty 
that nothing exists.<br>
 
17.20 
The sage is free. 
His empty mind no longer projects 
delusion, dreaming, dullness. 
This state is indescribable.<br>
 

18.1 
Praise That, 
which is Bliss itself, 
which is by nature stillness and light, 
and which by Its knowing 
reveals the world as a dream.<br>
 
18.2 
One may enjoy the abundant pleasures of the world, 
but will never be happy 
until giving them up.<br>
 
18.3 
How can one whose innermost heart 
has been scorched by the sun of sorrow 
that comes from duty 
be happy until the sweet rain 
of torrential stillness?<br>
 
18.4 
The universe is but a thought 
in Consciousness. 
In Reality it is nothing. 
One who sees the true nature  
of existence and non-existence 
never ceases to exist.<br>
 
18.5 
The Self--which is 
absolute, effortless, timeless, immaculate-- 
is without limits 
and at no distance from you. 
You are forever It.<br>
 
18.6 
For those whose vision becomes unclouded, 
illusion evaporates 
and the Self becomes known. 
All sorrow is instantly dispelled.<br>
 
18.7 
Seeing everything is imagination, 
knowing the Self as timelessly free, 
the sage lives as a child.<br>
 
18.8 
Knowing himself as Absolute, 
knowing existence and non-existence 
to be imagination only, 
what is there for the desireless one 
to learn, say or do?<br>
 
18.9 
Knowing for certain that all is Self, 
the sage has no trace of thoughts 
such as “I am this” or “I am not that.”<br>
 
18.10 
The yogi who finds stillness 
is neither distracted nor focused. 
He knows neither pleasure nor pain. 
Ignorance dispelled,  
he is free of knowing.<br>
 
18.11 
Heaven or poverty, 
gain or loss, 
society or solitude, 
to the yogi free of conditioning 
there is no difference.<br>
 
18.12 
Religious merit, 
sensory pleasure, 
worldly prosperity, 
discrimination between this and that— 
these have no significance 
to the yogi free of opposites 
such as “I do this” 
and “this I do not.”<br>
 
 
18.13 
The yogi who is liberated while living 
has no duties in this world, 
no attachments in his heart. 
His life proceeds without him.<br>
 
18.14 
For the great soul 
who abides beyond desire, 
where is illusion? 
Where is the universe? 
Where is meditation on That? 
Where even is liberation from them?<br>
 
18.15 
He who sees the world 
may try to renounce it. 
But what can the desireless one do? 
He sees there is nothing to see.<br>
 
18.16 
He who has seen the Supreme Brahma 
thinks, “I am Brahma.” 
But he who has transcended all thought, 
what can he think? 
He knows no other than Self.<br>
 
18.17 
He achieves self-control 
who sees his own distraction. 
But the great soul is not distracted. 
He has nothing to achieve. 
He has nothing to do.<br>
 
18.18 
The man of Knowledge 
may live as an ordinary man, 
but he is not. 
He sees he is neither 
focused nor distracted, 
and finds no fault with himself.<br>
 
 
18.19 
He who is beyond existence and non-existence-- 
who is wise, satisfied, free of desire-- 
does nothing, 
though the world may see him in motion.<br>
 
18.20 
The wise one 
is not troubled by action or inactivity. 
He lives happily,  
doing whatever gets done.<br>
 
18.21 
Like a leaf in the wind 
the liberated one 
is untethered from life-- 
desireless, independent, free.<br>
 
18.22 
For one who has transcended the world 
there is no joy or sorrow. 
With a stilled mind, 
he lives on with no body.<br>
 
18.23 
One who knows Self, 
whose mind is serene and spotless, 
does not desire to give up anything, 
nor does he miss what is not there.<br>
 
18.24 
His mind being in a natural state 
of emptiness, 
the wise one knows nothing 
of honor and dishonor. 
He does what comes to be done.<br>
 
18.25 
One who acts knowing 
“This is done by the body, not by I, pure Self,” 
indeed does nothing-- 
no matter how much acting takes place.<br>
 
18.26 
The liberated one 
acts without claiming to be acting, 
but he is no fool. 
He is blessed and happy 
even though in the world.<br>
 
18.27 
Having had enough 
of the endless workings of the mind, 
the wise one comes to rest. 
He neither thinks, nor knows, 
nor hears, nor sees.<br>
 
18.28 
Beyond stillness, 
beyond distraction, 
the great soul thinks nothing 
of liberation or bondage. 
Having seen the universe is void-- 
even though it seems to exist-- 
he is God.<br>
 
18.29 
He who believes he is a person 
is constantly acting, 
even when the body is at rest. 
The sage knows he is not a person, 
and therefore does nothing,  
even when the body is in motion.<br>
 
18.30 
The mind of the liberated one 
is neither troubled nor pleased. 
It is actionless, motionless, desireless 
and free of doubt.<br>
 
18.31 
The liberated one 
does not exert effort 
to meditate or act. 
Action and meditation just happen.<br>
 
18.32 
Hearing ultimate Truth, 
the dull-witted man is bewildered. 
The wise man hearing Truth 
retreats within and appears 
dull-witted.<br>
 
18.33 
The ignorant practice 
meditation and no-thought. 
The wise, 
like men in deep sleep, 
do nothing.<br>
 
18.34 
The ignorant man finds no peace 
either by effort or non-effort. 
The wise man 
by Truth alone is stilled.<br>
 
18.35 
Though they are by nature Self alone, 
pure intelligence, love and perfection; 
though they transcend the universe  
and are clearness itself,   
men of the world will not see this 
through meditation and practices.<br>
 
18.36 
The ignorant man 
will never be liberated 
by his repetitious practices. 
Blessed is he who 
by simple understanding 
enters timeless freedom.<br>
 
18.37 
Because he desires to know God, 
the ignorant man can never become That. 
The wise man is God 
because he is free of desire 
and knows nothing.<br>
 
18.38 
Unable to stand steady 
and eager for salvation, 
the ignorant perpetuate 
the illusion of world. 
Seeing the world 
as the source of all misery, 
the wise cut it off at the root.<br>
 
18.39 
The fool thinks peace comes 
by controlling the mind. 
He will never attain it. 
The wise one knows Truth, 
and is stillness itself.<br>
 
18.40 
For he who thinks knowledge  
is things and ideas 
how can there be Self-knowledge? 
The wise do not see separate things-- 
only the timeless Self.<br>
 
18.41 
The fool tries to control the mind 
with the mind—what folly! 
The wise one delights in Self alone. 
There is no mind to master.<br>
 
18.42 
Some believe in existence; 
others believe nothing exists. 
Rare is the one who believes nothing 
and is never confused.<br>
 
18.43 
Weak intellectuals may believe 
the Self is One without other. 
But being mired in illusion 
they do not actually know Self, 
so live out their lives in misery.<br>
 
 
18.44 
The mind of one seeking liberation 
depends on things for perception. 
The mind of the liberated one 
perceives no-thing 
and is free of desire.<br>
 
18.45 
Timid men fear sensory experience 
much as they do tigers. 
They seek refuge in caves 
and try to un-think the world.<br>
 
18.46 
Sensory experiences are like elephants who, 
upon encountering a desireless man, 
see him as a lion. 
They immediately turn on their heels, 
or if unable to escape, 
stay on to flatter and serve him.<br>
 
18.47 
A man with no doubts, 
who knows only Self, 
has no need of practice 
or liberation. 
Seeing, hearing, touching, smelling, eating— 
he lives as he is, happily.<br>
 
18.48 
One whose mind is emptied and unconflicted 
by the mere hearing of Truth 
sees nothing to do, 
nothing to avoid, 
nothing to warrant his indifference.<br>
 
18.49 
The sage does whatever 
appears to be done 
without thinking of good or bad. 
His actions are those of a child.<br>
 
 
18.50 
Depending on nothing, 
one finds happiness. 
Depending on nothing, 
one attains the Supreme. 
Depending on nothing, 
one passes through tranquility 
to One Self.<br>
 
18.51 
When one realizes 
he is neither the actor 
nor the one who watches, 
the mind-storm is stilled.<br>
 
18.52 
The actions of the sage, 
free of pretence and motive, 
shine like clear light. 
Not so those of the deluded seeker 
who affects a peaceful demeanor 
while remaining firmly attached.<br>
 
18.53 
Unbounded, unfettered, 
untethered from the projections of mind, 
the wise are free to play and enjoy, 
or retire to mountain caves.<br>
 
18.54 
Whether honoring a spiritual scholar, 
a god, or holy shrine; 
whether seeing a desirable woman,  
a king, or beloved friend-- 
the heart of the sage 
is unmoved.<br>
 
18.55 
Though his servants, sons, 
wives, daughters, grandchildren 
and all his relatives 
ridicule and despise him, 
the yogi is undismayed.<br>
 
18.56 
Though pleased he is not pleasured; 
though pained he does not suffer. 
This wonderful state is understood 
only by those like him.<br>
 
18.57 
The belief in duty 
creates a relative world 
for its performance. 
The wise one knows Himself 
to be formless, timeless,  
all-pervasive, immaculate, 
and thus transcends duty and world.<br>
 
18.58 
Even doing nothing 
the dull one is anxious and distracted. 
Even amidst great action 
the wise one remains still.<br>
 
18.59 
Even in practical life 
the wise one remains happy. 
Happy to sit, 
happy to sleep, 
happy to move about, 
happy to speak, 
happy to eat…<br>
 
18.60 
Because he knows Self 
the wise one is not disrupted by practical life. 
He is deep and still, like a vast lake. 
He is not like ordinary people. 
His sorrows have vanished.<br>
 
18.61 
For the deluded one, 
even rest is an activity. 
For the wise, 
even action bears the fruit of stillness.<br>
 
18.62 
The deluded one is often adverse 
to the things of his life. 
To one with no thought for body, 
attachment and aversion have no meaning.<br>
 
18.63 
The deluded mind is caught up 
in thinking and not thinking. 
Though the mind of the wise one 
may think what thoughts come, 
he is not aware of it.<br>
 
18.64 
The sage sees nothing being done 
even when performed by his hands. 
Like a child he is pure 
and acts without reason.<br>
 
18.65 
Blessed indeed is he who knows Self. 
Though seeing, hearing, touching, smelling, eating, 
he never desires nor changes.<br>
 
18.66 
For one who is void and changeless, 
where is the world and its imaginings? 
Where is the end? 
Where is the possibility of it?<br>
 
18.67 
Glorious indeed is he who, 
free of desire, 
embodies Bliss itself. 
He has become absorbed in Self.<br>
 
18.68 
In short, the great soul 
who has realized Truth 
is free of desire, enjoyment and liberation. 
In all of space and time 
he is attached to nothing.<br>
 
18.69 
What remains for One 
who is Consciousness itself, 
who sees the non-existence 
of a phenomenal world created 
by the mere thought of a name?<br>
 
18.70 
Peace is natural for one 
who knows for certain nothing exists, 
who sees appearances are illusion,  
to whom the inexpressible is apparent.<br>
 
18.71 
Rules of conduct, detachment, 
renunciation, asceticism— 
what are these to one 
who sees the unreality of things, 
who is the Light of Awareness?<br>
 
18.72 
How can there be joy or sorrow, 
bondage or liberation, 
for one who perceives non-existence 
and lights the infinite?<br>
 
18.73 
Until Self-realization, 
illusion prevails. 
The sage lives without 
thoughts of “I” or “mine.”  
His connection to illusion is severed.<br>
 
18.74 
What is knowledge? 
What is the universe? 
What are  thoughts like 
“I am the body,” or “the body is mine”? 
The sage is imperishable and sorrowless. 
He is Self alone.<br>
 
 
18.75 
When a weak man gives up meditation 
he falls prey to whims and desires.<br>
 
18.76 
Even hearing Truth, 
the man of dull intellect 
holds on to illusion. 
Through effort and suppression 
he may appear outwardly composed, 
but inside he craves the world.<br>
 
18.77 
Though others may see him working, 
the sage does nothing. 
Knowledge has banished effort.  
He finds no reason to do or say.<br>
 
18.78 
The sage is fearless, unassailable. 
No darkness, no light, nothing to lose. 
Nothing.<br>
 
18.79 
Patience, discrimination, 
even fearlessness— 
What use are these to the yogi? 
His nature cannot be described. 
He is not a person.<br>
 
18.80 
No heaven, no hell, 
no liberation for the living. 
In short, Consciousness is Void. 
What more can be said?<br>
 
18.81 
The sage neither yearns for fulfillment 
nor frets over non-attainment. 
His mind is cool 
and brimming with sweetness.<br>
 
 
18.82 
Detached from desire, 
the sage neither praises peace 
nor blames the wicked. 
Equally content  
in happiness and misery, 
he would not change a thing.<br>
 
18.83 
The sage neither rejects the world 
nor desires Self. 
He is free of joy and sorrow. 
He does not live 
and cannot die.<br>
 
18.84 
The wise one lives without hope. 
He has no attachment to his children, wife or anyone. 
Pleasure means nothing to him. 
His life is glorious.<br>
 
18.85 
The sage wanders about as he pleases 
and lives on whatever may come. 
Contentment ever dwells in his heart. 
And when the sun sets, 
he rests where he is.<br>
 
18.86 
Rooted in Being, 
no thought of being born or reborn, 
the great soul is indifferent 
to the death or birth of his body.<br>
 
18.87 
The wise one stands alone, 
caring for nothing, 
bereft of possessions. 
He goes where he will, 
unhindered by opposites,  
his doubts rent asunder. 
He is truly blessed.<br>
 
18.88 
The wise one has no sense of “mine.” 
To him earth, stone and gold are the same. 
The knots of his heart have unraveled. 
He knows neither ignorance nor sorrow. 
He is excellent in every way.<br>
 
18.89 
The liberated soul 
has no desire in his heart. 
He is content and indifferent. 
He has no equal.<br>
 
18.90 
Only one free of desire 
knows nothing of knowing, 
says nothing needs saying, 
sees nothing to see.<br>
 
18.91 
He who is without desire excels, 
be he beggar or king. 
He no longer sees good or bad.<br>
 
18.92 
What is lust or restraint, 
or the desire for Truth 
to the yogi who has reached life’s goal, 
and who embodies virtue and sincerity?<br>
 
18.93 
The inner experience of one 
who is free of desire and suffering, 
who is content and reposes in Self-- 
how can it be described, 
and of whom?<br>
 
18.94 
The wise one’s state never varies. 
Sleeping soundly, he is not asleep. 
Lying in reverie, he is not dreaming. 
Eyes open, he is not wakeful.<br>
 
18.95 
The man of Knowledge seems to think, 
but has no thoughts. 
He seems to have sense perceptions, 
but does not experience. 
He seems to have intelligence, 
but is empty-minded. 
He appears to be a person, 
but is not.<br>
 
18.96 
The man of Knowledge 
is neither happy nor miserable, 
neither detached nor attached, 
neither liberated nor seeking liberation. 
He is neither this nor that.<br>
 
18.97 
Even while distracted the blessed one is still. 
In meditation, he does not meditate. 
In ignorance, he remains clear.  
Though learned, he knows nothing.<br>
 
18.98 
The liberated one, 
who abides unconditionally in Self, 
who is free of the concept of action and duty, 
who is always and everywhere the same, 
is desireless. 
He does not worry 
about what he did or did not do.<br>
 
18.99 
The wise one is neither pleased by praise, 
nor annoyed by blame. 
He neither rejoices in life 
nor fears death.<br>
 
18.100 
One of tranquil mind 
seeks neither crowds nor wilderness. 
He is the same wherever he goes.<br>
 
 

19.1 
With the tongs of Truth 
I have plucked the thorn of thinking 
from the innermost cave 
of my heart.<br>
 
19.2 
Where is meditation, pleasure, 
prosperity or discrimination? 
Where is duality?  
Where even is Unity? 
I abide in the glory of Self.<br>

Where is past and future, 
or even present? 
Where is space, or even eternity?

Where is not-Self? 
Where is good and evil, confusion and clarity?

or even the fourth state? 
Where is fear? 
I abide in the glory of Self.<br>
 
19.6 
Where is close or far, 
in or out, 
gross or subtle? 
I abide in the glory of Self.<br>
 
19.7 
Where is life and death? 
Where is the world and worldly relations? 
Where is distraction and stillness? 
I abide in the glory of Self.<br>
 
19.8 
There is no need to talk about 
the three ends of life. 
To talk of yoga is purposeless. 
Even talking about Truth is irrelevant. 
I rest in Self alone.<br>

I am empty of thought.<br>

I am boundless, Absolute.<br>
 
20.14

Nothing emanates from me. 
No more can be said.<br>

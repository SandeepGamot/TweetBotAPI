The serpent may, without being poisonous, raise high its hood, but the
show of terror is enough to frighten people -- whether he be venomous
or not.

<br>

Our bodies are perishable, wealth is not at all permanent and death is
always nearby. Therefore we must immediately engage in acts of merit.

<br>

Poverty, disease, sorrow, imprisonment and other evils are the fruits
borne by the tree of one's own sins.

<br>

A man may live but for a moment, but that moment should be spent in
doing auspicious deeds. It is useless living even for a kalpa (4,320,000
*1000 years) and bringing only distress upon the two worlds (this world
and the next).

<br>

The student, the servant, the traveller, the hungry person, the frightened
man, the treasury guard, and the steward: these seven ought to be
awakened if they fall asleep.

<br>

Brahmanas quit their patrons after receiving alms from them, scholars
leave their teachers after receiving education from them, and animals
desert a forest that has been burnt down.

<br>

It is not strange if a man reviles (Degrades) a thing of which he has no
knowledge, just as a wild hunter's wife throws away the pearl that is
found in the head of an elephant, and picks up a gunj(a type of seed
which poor tribals wear as ornaments).

<br>

One destitute of wealth is not destitute, he is indeed rich (if he is
learned); but the man devoid of learning is destitute in every way.

<br>

O see what a wonder it is! The doings of the great are strange: they treat
wealth as light as a straw, yet, when they obtain it, they bend under its
weight.

<br>

When a man has no strength left in him he becomes a sadhu, one
without wealth acts like a brahmacari, a sick man behaves like a
devotee of the Lord, and when a woman grows old she becomes
devoted to her husband.

<br>

There are two nectarean fruits hanging from the tree of this world: one
is the hearing of sweet words (such as Krishna-katha) and the other, the
society of saintly men.

<br>

The life of an uneducated man is as useless as the tail of a dog which
neither covers its rear end, nor protects it from the bites of insects.

<br>

Poverty is set off by fortitude; shabby garments by keeping them clean;
bad food by warming it; and ugliness by good behaviour.

<br>

Wealth, a friend, a wife, and a kingdom may be regained; but this body
when lost may never be acquired again.

<br>

Water is the medicine for indigestion; it is invigorating when the food
that is eaten is well digested; it is like nectar when drunk in the middle
of a dinner; and it is like poison when taken at the end of a meal.

<br>

Sinfully acquired wealth may remain for ten years; in the eleventh year
it disappears with even the original stock.

<br>

The eating of tundi fruit deprives a man of his sense, while the vacha
root administered revives his reasoning immediately. A woman at once
robs a man of his vigour while milk at once restores it.

<br>

Therefore kings gather round themselves men of good families, for they
never forsake them either at the beginning, the middle or the end.

<br>

Even one who by his qualities appears to be all knowing suffers without
patronage; the gem, though precious, requires a gold setting.

<br>

It is better to live under a tree in a jungle inhabited by tigers and
elephants, to maintain oneself in such a place with ripe fruits and
spring water, to lie down on grass and to wear the ragged barks of
trees than to live amongst one's relations when reduced to poverty.

<br>

A single son endowed with good qualities is far better than a hundred
devoid of them. For the moon, though one, dispels the darkness, which
the stars, though numerous, can not.

<br>

The brahmana who is engrossed in worldly affairs, brings up cows and
is engaged in trade is really called a vaishya.

<br>

One should feel satisfied with the following three things; his own wife,
food given by Providence and wealth acquired by honest effort; but one
should never feel satisfied with the following three; study, chanting the
holy names of the Lord (japa) and charity.

<br>

Moral excellence is an ornament for personal beauty; righteous
conduct, for high birth; success for learning; and proper spending for
wealth.

<br>

O lady, why are you gazing downward? Has something of yours fallen 
on the ground? (She replies) O fool, can you not understand the pearl of
my youth has slipped away?

<br>

He who is engrossed in family life will never acquire knowledge; there
can be no mercy in the eater of flesh; the greedy man will not be
truthful; and purity will not be found in a woman and a hunter.

<br>

Those born blind cannot see; similarly blind are those in the grip of lust.
Proud men have no perception of evil; and those bent on acquiring
riches see no sin in their actions.

<br>

He who lives in our mind is near though he may actually be far away;
but he who is not in our heart is far though he may really be nearby.

<br>

Women have hunger two-fold, shyness four-fold, daring six-fold, and
lust eight-fold as compared to men.

<br>

Consider again and again the following: the right time, the right friends,
the right place, the right means of income, the right ways of spending,
and from whom you derive your power.

<br>

We should repay the favours of others by acts of kindness; so also
should we return evil for evil in which there is no sin, for it is necessary
to pay a wicked man in his own coin.

<br>

Indolent application ruins study; money is lost when entrusted to others;
a farmer who sows his seed sparsely is ruined; and an army is lost for
want of a commander.

<br>

Those who blaspheme Vedic wisdom, who ridicule the life style
recommended in the satras, and who deride men of peaceful
temperament, come to grief unnecessarily.

<br>

In this world, whose family is there without blemish? Who is free from
sickness and grief? Who is forever happy?

<br>

The brahmana is like tree; his prayers are the roots, his chanting of
the Vedas are the branches, and his religious act are the leaves.
Consequently effort should be made to preserve his roots for if the
roots are destroyed there can be no branches or leaves.

<br>

The power of a king lies in his mighty arms; that of a brahmana in his
spiritual knowledge; and that of a woman in her beauty youth and sweet
words.

<br>

He is a true friend who does not forsake us in time of need, misfortune,
famine, or war, in a king's court, or at the crematorium (smasana).

<br>

Among birds the crow is vile; among beasts the dog; the ascetic whose
sins is abominable, but he who blasphemes others is the worst
chandala.

<br>

Therefore with an eye to the public good, I shall speak that which, when
understood, will lead to an understanding of things in their proper
perspective.

<br>

He whose hands are clean does not like to hold an office; he who
desires nothing cares not for bodily decorations; he who is only
partially educated cannot speak agreeably; and he who speaks out
plainly cannot be a deceiver.

<br>

A man who encounters the following three is unfortunate; the death of
his wife in his old age, the entrusting of money into the hands of
relatives, and depending upon others for food.

<br>

Realised learning (vidya) is our friend while travelling , the wife is a
friend at home, medicine is the friend of a sick man, and meritorious
deeds are the friends at death.

<br>

Of those who have studied the Vedas for material rewards, and those
who accept foodstuffs offered by shudras, what potency have they?
They are just like serpents without fangs.

<br>

Of a rascal and a serpent, the serpent is the better of the two, for he
strikes only at the time he is destined to kill, while the former at every
step.

<br>

The unthinking spender, the homeless urchin, the quarrel
monger, the man who neglects his wife and is heedless in
his actions -- all these will soon come to ruination.

<br>

A wise man should not reveal his loss of wealth, the vexation of his
mind, the misconduct of his own wife, base words spoken by others,
and disgrace that has befallen him.

<br>

Though persons be born from the same womb and under the same stars,
they do not become alike in disposition as the thousand fruits of the
badari tree.

<br>

He who regards another's wife as his mother, the wealth that does not
belong to him as a lump of mud, and the pleasure and pain of all other
living beings as his own -- truly sees things in the right perspective, and
he is a true pandit.

<br>

Do not stay for a single day where there are not these five persons: a
wealthy man, a brahmana well versed in Vedic lore, a king, a river and
a physician.

<br>

Who realises all the happiness he desires? Everything is in the hands of
God. Therefore one should learn contentment.

<br>

What is too heavy for the strong and what place is too distant for those
who put forth effort? What country is foreign to a man of true learning?
Who can be inimical to one who speaks pleasingly?

<br>

Heaven is but a straw to him who knows spiritual life (Krsna
consciousness); so is life to a valiant man; a woman to him who has
subdued his senses; and the universe to him who is without attachment
for the world.

<br>

The fool (mudha) who fancies that a charming young lady loves him,
becomes her slave and he dances like a shakuntala bird tied to a string.

<br>

Constant travel brings old age upon a man; a horse becomes old by
being constantly tied up; lack of sexual contact with her husband brings
old age upon a woman; and garments become old through being left in
the sun.

<br>

One who devotedly gives a little to a brahmana who is in distress is
recompensed abundantly. Hence, O Prince, what is given to a good
brahmana is got back not in an equal quantity, but in an infinitely
higher degree.

<br>

Among men the barber is cunning; among birds the crow; among beasts
the jackal; and among women, the malin (flower girl).

<br>

The wise who discern the essence of things have declared that the
yavana (meat eater) is equal in baseness to a thousand candalas the
lowest class), and hence a yavana is the basest of men; indeed there is
no one more base.

<br>

To have ability for eating when dishes are ready at hand, to be robust
and virile in the company of one's religiously wedded wife, and to have
a mind for making charity when one is prosperous are the fruits of no
ordinary austerities.

<br>

The prostitute has to forsake a man who has no money, the subject a
king that cannot defend him, the birds in a tree that bears no fruit, and
the guests in a house after they have finished their meals.

<br>

A king, a prostitute, Lord Yamaraja, fire, a thief, a young boy, and a
beggar cannot understand the suffering of others. The eighth of this
category is the tax collector.

<br>

He who has wealth has friends and relations; he alone survives and is
respected as a man.

<br>

The earth is encumbered with the weight of the flesh-eaters, wine-
bibblers, dolts and blockheads, who are beasts in the form of men.

<br>

Knowledge is lost without putting it into practice; a man is lost due to
ignorance; an army is lost without a commander; and a woman is lost
without a husband.

<br>

Foolishness is indeed painful, and verily so is youth, but more painful
by far than either is being obliged in another person's house.

<br>

Those who were not satiated with the enjoyment of wealth, food and
women have all passed away; there are others now passing away who
have likewise remained unsatiated; and in the future still others will
pass away feeling themselves unsatiated.

<br>

He who is overly attached to his family members experiences fear and
sorrow, for the root of all grief is attachment. Thus one should discard
attachment to be happy.

<br>

Do not let your foot touch fire, the spiritual master or a brahmana; it
must never touch a cow, a virgin, an old person or a child.

<br>

Do not be very upright in your dealings for you would see by going to
the forest that straight trees are cut down while crooked ones are left
standing.

<br>

A wise man should marry a virgin of a respectable family even if she is
deformed. He should not marry one of a low-class family, through
beauty. Marriage in a family of equal status is preferable.

<br>

Learn one thing from a lion; one from a crane; four from a cock; five
from a crow; six from a dog; and three from an ass.

<br>

The good habits of charity, learning and austerity practised during many
past lives continue to be cultivated in this birth by virtue of the link
(yoga) of this present life to the previous ones.

<br>

Accumulated wealth is saved by spending just as incoming fresh water
is saved by letting out stagnant water.

<br>

My dear child, if you desire to be free from the cycle of birth and death,
then abandon the objects of sense gratification as poison. Drink instead
the nectar of forbearance, upright conduct, mercy, cleanliness and truth.

<br>

He who for one year eats his meals silently (inwardly meditating upon
the Lord's prasadam); attains to the heavenly planets for a thousand
crore of years. ( Note: one crore equals ten million)

<br>

Do not put your trust in a bad companion nor even trust an ordinary
friend, for if he should get angry with you, he may bring all your secrets
to light.

<br>

Kings speak for once, men of learning once, and the daughter is given
in marriage once. All these things happen once and only once.

<br>

Anger is a personification of Yama (the demigod of death); thirst is like
the hellish river Vaitarani; knowledge is like a kamadhenu (the cow of
plenty); and contentment is like Nandanavana (the garden of Indra).

<br>

The following qualities of the denizens of hell may characterise men on
earth; extreme wrath, harsh speech, enmity with one's relations, the
company with the base, and service to men of low extraction.

<br>

As gold is tested in four ways by rubbing, cutting, heating and beating -
- so a man should be tested by these four things: his renunciation, his
conduct, his qualities and his actions.

<br>

Scriptural lessons not put into practice are poison; a meal is poison to
him who suffers from indigestion; a social gathering is poison to a
poverty stricken person; and a young wife is poison to an aged man.

<br>

The hearts of base men burn before the fire of other's fame, and they
slander them being themselves unable to rise to such a high position.

<br>

What is the use of having many sons if they cause grief and vexation? It
is better to have only one son from whom the whole family can derive
support and peacefulness.

<br>

The man who remains a fool even in advanced age is really a fool, just
as the Indra-Varuna fruit does not become sweet no matter how ripe it
might become.

<br>

(It is said that a sadhu, when asked about his family, replied thusly):
truth is my mother, and my father is spiritual knowledge; righteous
conduct is my brother, and mercy is my friend, inner peace is my wife,
and forgiveness is my son: these six are my kinsmen.

<br>

Charity puts an end to poverty; righteous conduct to misery; discretion
to ignorance; and scrutiny to fear.

<br>

As centesimal droppings will fill a pot so also are knowledge, virtue
and wealth gradually obtained.

<br>

What good can the scriptures do to a man who has no sense of his
own? Of what use is as mirror to a blind man?

<br>

Give your daughter in marriage to a good family, engage your son in
learning, see that your enemy comes to grief, and engage your friends
in dharma. (Krsna consciousness).

<br>

The brahmana who steals the property of the Deities and the spiritual
preceptor, who cohabits with another's wife, and who maintains himself
by eating anything and everything s called a chandala.

<br>

These five are your fathers; he who gave you birth, girdled you with
sacred thread, teaches you, provides you with food, and protects you
from fearful situations.

<br>

Brahmanas find satisfaction in a good meal, peacocks in the peal of
thunder, a sadhu in seeing the prosperity of others, and the wicked in
the misery of others.

<br>

Save your wealth against future calamity. Do not say, "What what fear
has a rich man of calamity?" When riches begin to forsake one even the
accumulated stock dwindles away.

<br>

Do not put your trust in rivers, men who carry weapons, beasts with
claws or horns, women, and members of a royal family.

<br>

By means of hearing one understands dharma, malignity vanishes,
knowledge is acquired, and liberation from material bondage is gained.

<br>

It is better to be without a kingdom than to rule over a petty one; better
to be without a friend than to befriend a rascal; better to be without a
disciple than to have a stupid one; and better to be without a wife than
to have a bad one.

<br>

He who sheds bodily identification by means of knowledge of the
indwelling Supreme Self (Paramatma), will always be absorbed in
meditative trance (samadhi) wherever his mind leads him.

<br>

The wicked man will not attain sanctity even if he is instructed in
different ways, and the nim tree will not become sweet even if it is
sprinkled from the top to the roots with milk and ghee.

<br>

A wise man should not divulge the formula of a medicine which he has
well prepared; an act of charity which he has performed; domestic
conflicts; private affairs with his wife; poorly prepared food he may
have been offered; or slang he may have heard.

<br>

Low class men desire wealth; middle class men both wealth and
respect; but the noble, honour only; hence honour is the noble man's
true wealth.

<br>

Wise men should always bring up their sons in various moral ways, for
children who have knowledge of niti-sastra and are well-behaved
become a glory to their family.

<br>

He who neither rouses fear by his anger, nor confers a favour when he
is pleased can neither control nor protect. What can he do?

<br>

The spirit soul goes through his own course of karma and he himself
suffers the good and bad results thereby accrued. By his own actions he
entangles himself in samsara, and by his own efforts he extricates
himself.

<br>

Although an ass is tired, he continues to carry his burden; he is
unmindful of cold and heat; and he is always contented; these three
things should be learned from the ass.

<br>

Untruthfulness, rashness, guile, stupidity, avarice, uncleanliness and
cruelty are a women's seven natural flaws.

<br>

He who nurtures benevolence for all creatures within his heart
overcomes all difficulties and will be the recipient of all types of riches
at every step.

<br>

If good qualities should characterise a man of discrimination, the
brilliance of his qualities will be recognised just as a gem which is
essentially bright really shines when fixed in an ornament of gold.

<br>

Avoid him who talks sweetly before you but tries to ruin you behind
your back, for he is like a pitcher of poison with milk on top.

<br>

Fish, tortoises, and birds bring up their young by means of sight,
attention and touch; so do saintly men afford protection to their
associates by the same means.

<br>

By offending a kinsman, life is lost; by offending others, wealth is
lost; by offending the king, everything is lost; and by offending a
brahmana one's whole family is ruined.

<br>

Those blessed souls are certainly elevated who, while crossing the
ocean of life, take shelter of a genuine brahmana, who is likened unto a
boat. They are unlike passengers aboard an ordinary ship which runs
the risk of sinking.

<br>

As is the desire of Providence, so functions one's intellect; one's
activities are also controlled by Providence; and by the will of
Providence one is surrounded by helpers.

<br>

Friendship between equals flourishes, service under a king is
respectable, it is good to be business-minded in public dealings, and a
handsome lady is safe in her own home.

<br>

He who is prepared for the future and he who deals cleverly with any
situation that may arise are both happy; but the fatalistic man who
wholly depends on luck is ruined.

<br>

The one excellent thing that can be learned from a lion is that whatever
a man intends doing should be done by him with a whole-hearted and
strenuous effort.

<br>

Water seeping into the earth is pure; and a devoted wife is pure; the
king who is the benefactor of his people is pure; and pure is the
brahmana who is contented.

<br>

Courtesy should be learned from princes, the art of conversation from
pandits, lying should be learned from gamblers and deceitful ways
should be learned from women.

<br>

One indeed becomes blessed by having darshan of a devotee; for the
devotee has the ability to purify immediately, whereas the sacred tirtha
gives purity only after prolonged contact.

<br>

We should always speak what would please the man of whom we
expect a favour, like the hunter who sings sweetly when he desires to
shoot a deer.

<br>

Even as the unborn babe is in the womb of his mother, these five are
fixed as his life destiny: his life span, his activities, his acquisition of
wealth and knowledge, and his time of death.

<br>

I consider him who does not act religiously as dead though living, but
he who dies acting religiously unquestionably lives long though he is
dead.

<br>

Lakshmi, the Goddess of wealth, comes of Her own accord where fools
are not respected, grain is well stored up, and the husband and wife do
not quarrel.

<br>

Do not reveal what you have thought upon doing, but by wise council
keep it secret being determined to carry it into execution.

<br>

The happiness and peace attained by those satisfied by the nectar of
spiritual tranquillity is not attained by greedy persons restlessly moving
here and there.

<br>

Offspring, friends and relatives flee from a devotee of the Lord: yet
those who follow him bring merit to their families through their
devotion.

<br>

There is poison in the fang of the serpent, in the mouth of the fly and in
the sting of a scorpion; but the wicked man is saturated with it.

<br>

What is there to be enjoyed in the world of Lord Indra for one whose
wife is loving and virtuous, who possesses wealth, who has a well-
behaved son endowed with good qualities, and who has a grandchildren
born of his children?

<br>

That man who is without religion and mercy should be rejected. A guru
without spiritual knowledge should be rejected. The wife with an
offensive face should be given up, and so should relatives who are
without affection.

<br>

The cuckoos remain silent for a long time (for several seasons) until
they are able to sing sweetly (in the Spring ) so as to give joy to all.

<br>

To wake at the proper time; to take a bold stand and fight; to make a
fair division (of property) among relations; and to earn one's own bread
by personal exertion are the four excellent things to be learned from a
cock.

<br>

These five: the life-span, the type of work, wealth, learning and the time
of one's death are determined while one is in the womb.

<br>

He whose son is obedient to him, whose wife's conduct is in accordance
with his wishes, and who is content with his riches, has his heaven here
on earth.

<br>

He who has acquired neither virtue, wealth, satisfaction of desires nor
salvation (dharma, artha, kama, moksa), lives an utterly useless life,
like the "nipples" hanging from the neck of a goat.

<br>

Discontented brahmanas, contented kings, shy prostitutes, and
immodest housewives are ruined.

<br>

The brahmana who thwarts the doings of others, who is hypocritical,
selfish, and a deceitful hater, and while speaking mildly cherishes
cruelty in his heart, is called a cat.

<br>

A father who is a chronic debtor, an adulterous mother, a beautiful wife,
and an unlearned son are enemies ( in one's own home).

<br>

We should not feel pride in our charity, austerity, valour, scriptural
knowledge, modesty and morality for the world is full of the rarest
gems.

<br>

One should save his money against hard times, save his wife at the
sacrifice of his riches, but invariably one should save his soul even at
the sacrifice of his wife and riches.

<br>

A man attains greatness by his merits, not simply by occupying an
exalted seat. Can we call a crow an eagle (garuda) simply because he
sits on the top of a tall building.

<br>

I do not deserve that wealth which is to be attained by enduring much
suffering, or by transgressing the rules of virtue, or by flattering an
enemy.

<br>

Residing in a small village devoid of proper living facilities, serving a
person born of a low family, unwholesome food, a frowning wife, a
foolish son, and a widowed daughter burn the body without fire.

<br>

Conciliate a covetous man by
means of a gift, an obstinate man with folded hands in
salutation, a fool by humouring him, and a learned man by truthful
words.

<br>

The heart of a woman is not united; it is divided. While she is talking
with one man, she looks lustfully at another and thinks fondly of a third
in her heart.

<br>

He who wears unclean garments, has dirty teeth, as a glutton, speaks
unkindly and sleeps after sunrise -- although he may be the greatest
personality -- will lose the favour of Lakshmi.

<br>

There is no austerity equal to a balanced mind, and there is no
happiness equal to contentment; there is no disease like covetousness,
and no virtue like mercy.

<br>

Those that are empty-minded cannot be benefited by instruction.
Bamboo does not acquire the quality of sandalwood by being
associated with the Malaya Mountain.

<br>

If the king is virtuous, then the subjects are also virtuous. If the king is
sinful, then the subjects also become sinful. If he is mediocre, then the
subjects are mediocre. The subjects follow the example of the king. In
short, as is the king so are the subjects.

<br>

The brahmana who destroys a pond, a well, a tank, a garden and a
temple is called a mleccha.

<br>

Those who are destitute of learning, penance, knowledge, good
disposition, virtue and benevolence are brutes wandering the earth in
the form of men. They are burdensome to the earth.

<br>

Beauty is spoiled by an immoral nature; noble birth by bad conduct;
learning, without being perfected; and wealth by not being properly
utilised.

<br>

After having rubbed oil on the body, after encountering the smoke from
a funeral pyre, after sexual intercourse, and after being shaved, one
remains a chandala until he bathes.

<br>

At the end of the yuga, Mount Meru may be shaken; at the end of the
kalpa, the waters of the seven oceans may be disturbed; but a sadhu
will never swerve from the spiritual path.

<br>

If the bees which seek the liquid oozing from the head of a lust-
intoxicated elephant are driven away by the flapping of his ears, then
the elephant has lost only the ornament of his head. The bees are quite
happy in the lotus filled lake.

<br>

There is no water like rainwater; no strength like one's own; no light
like that of the eyes; and no wealth more dear than food grain.

<br>

There is no enemy like a yajna (sacrifice) which consumes the kingdom
when not attended by feeding on a large scale; consumes the priest
when the chanting is not done properly; and consumes the yajaman (the
responsible person) when the gifts are not made.

<br>

Learning is a friend on the journey; a wife in the house; medicine in
sickness; and religious merit is the only friend after death.

<br>

The man who is praised by others as great is regarded as worthy though
he may be really void of all merit. But the man who sings his own
praises lowers himself in the estimation of others though he should be
Indra (the possessor of all excellences).

<br>

As a calf follows its mother among a thousand cows, so the (good or
bad) deeds of a man follow him.

<br>

My mother is Kamala devi (Lakshmi), my father is Lord Janardana
(Vishnu), my kinsmen are the Vishnu-bhaktas (Vaisnavas) and, my
homeland is all the three worlds.

<br>
Humbly bowing down before the almighty Lord Sri Vishnu, the Lord of
the three worlds, I recite maxims of the science of political ethics (niti)
selected from the various satras.

<br>

Keep one thousand cubits away from an elephant, a hundred from a
horse, ten from a horned beast, but keep away from the wicked by
leaving the country.

<br>

Nectar (amrita) is the best among medicines; eating good food is the
best of all types of material happiness; the eye is the chief among all
organs; and the head occupies the chief position among all parts of the
body.

<br>

The earth is supported by the power of truth; it is the power of truth that
makes the sun shine and the winds blow; indeed all things rest upon
truth.

<br>

He who loses his money is forsaken by his friends, his wife, his
servants and his relations; yet when he regains his riches those who
have forsaken him come back to him. Hence wealth is certainly the best
of relations.

<br>

The wise man should not be anxious about his food; he should be
anxious to be engaged only in dharma (Krishna consciousness). the
food of each man is created for him at his birth.

<br>

Fondle a son until he is five years of age, and use the stick for another
ten years, but when he has attained his sixteenth year treat him as a
friend.

<br>

Trees on a river bank, a woman in another man's house, and kings
without counsellors go without doubt to swift destruction.

<br>

Swans live wherever there is water, and leave the place where water
dries up; let not a man act so -- and come and go as he pleases.

<br>

Test a servant while in the discharge of his duty, a relative in difficulty,
a friend in adversity, and a wife in misfortune.

<br>

She is a true wife who is clean (suci), expert, chaste, pleasing to the
husband, and truthful.

<br>

The wise man should restrain his senses like the crane and accomplish
his purpose with due knowledge of his place, time and ability.

<br>

One may know the four Vedas and the Dharma-sastras, yet if he has no
realisation of his own spiritual self, he can be said to be like the ladle
which stirs all kinds of foods but knows not the taste of any.

<br>

The poor wish for wealth; animals for the faculty of speech; men wish
for heaven; and godly persons for liberation.

<br>

Even the man who has taught the spiritual significance of just one letter
ought to be worshiped. He who does not give reverence to such a guru
is born as a dog a hundred times, and at last takes birth as a chandala
(dog-eater).

<br>

Wise men should never go into a country where there are no means of
earning one's livelihood, where the people have no dread of anybody,
have no sense of shame, no intelligence, or a charitable disposition.

<br>

All the creatures are pleased by loving words; and therefore we should
address words that are pleasing to all, for there is no lack of sweet
words.

<br>

Men reap the fruits of their deeds, and intellects bear the mark of deeds
performed in previous lives; even so the wise act after due
circumspection.

<br>

A learned man is honoured by the people. A learned man commands
respect everywhere for his learning. Indeed, learning is honoured
everywhere.

<br>

Fate makes a beggar a king and a king a beggar. He makes a rich man
poor and a poor man rich.

<br>

We should secure and keep the following: the blessings of meritorious
deeds, wealth, grain, the words of the spiritual master, and rare
medicines. Otherwise life becomes impossible.

<br>

Separation from the wife, disgrace from one's own people, an enemy
saved in battle, service to a wicked king, poverty, and a mismanaged
assembly: these six kinds of evils, if afflicting a person, burn him even
without fire.

<br>

They alone are sons who are devoted to their father. He is a father who
supports his sons. He is a friend in whom we can confide, and she only
is a wife in whose company the husband feels contented and peaceful.

<br>

The king is obliged to accept the sins of his subjects; the purohit (priest)
suffers for those of the king; a husband suffers for those of his wife; and
the guru suffers for those of his pupils.

<br>

The king, the brahmana, and the ascetic yogi who go abroad are
respected; but the woman who wanders is utterly ruined.

<br>

Purity of speech, of the mind, of the senses, and the of a compassionate
heart are needed by one who desires to rise to the divine platform.

<br>

He who gives up shyness in monetary dealings, in acquiring
knowledge, in eating and in business, becomes happy.

<br>

The serpent, the king, the tiger, the stinging wasp, the small child, the
dog owned by other people, and the fool: these seven ought not to be
awakened from sleep.

<br>

Oil on water, a secret communicated to a base man, a gift given to a
worthy receiver, and scriptural instruction given to an intelligent man
spread out by virtue of their nature.

<br>

He who is not shy in the acquisition of wealth, grain and knowledge,
and in taking his meals, will be happy

<br>

Learning is like a cow of desire. It, like her, yields in all seasons. Like a
mother, it feeds you on your journey. Therefore learning is a hidden
treasure.

<br>

A still-born son as superior to a foolish son endowed with a long life.
The first causes grief for but a moment while the latter like a blazing
fire consumes his parents in grief for life.

<br>

Eschew (Avoid) wicked company and associate with saintly persons.
Acquire virtue day and night, and always meditate on that which is
eternal forgetting that which is temporary.

<br>

Let not a single day pass without your learning a verse, half a verse, or
a fourth of it, or even one letter of it; nor without attending to charity,
study and other pious activity.

<br>

There is no treasure on earth the gift of which will cancel the debt a
disciple owes his guru for having taught him even a single letter ( that
leads to Krishna consciousness).

<br>

If men should always retain the state of mind they experience when
hearing religious instruction, when present at a crematorium ground,
and when in sickness -- then who could not attain liberation.

<br>

The beggar is a miser's enemy; the wise counsellor is the fool's
enemy; her husband is an adulterous wife's enemy; and the moon is
the enemy of the thief.

<br>

He who desires sense gratification must give up all thoughts of
acquiring knowledge; and he who seeks knowledge must not hope for
sense gratification. How can he who seeks sense gratification acquire
knowledge, and he who possesses knowledge enjoy mundane sense
pleasure?

<br>

As a single withered tree, if set aflame, causes a whole forest to burn, so
does a rascal son destroy a whole family.

<br>

What is it that escapes the observation of poets? What is that act
women are incapable of doing? What will drunken people not prate?
What will not a crow eat?

<br>

What good is a cow that neither gives milk nor conceives? Similarly,
what is the value of the birth of a son if he becomes neither learned nor
a pure devotee of the Lord?

<br>

There are two ways to get rid of thorns and wicked persons; using
footwear in the first case and in the second shaming them so that they
cannot raise their faces again thus keeping them at a distance.

<br>

As long as your body is healthy and under control and death is distant,
try to save your soul; when death is immanent what can you do?

<br>

All charities and sacrifices (performed for fruitive gain) bring only
temporary results, but gifts made to deserving persons (those who are
Krishna consciousness) and protection offered to all creatures shall
never perish.

<br>

Arjuna says to Krishna. "Brahmanas find joy in going to feasts, cows
find joy in eating their tender grass, wives find joy in the company of
their husbands, and know, O Krishna, that in the same way I rejoice in
battle.

<br>

He is a chandala who eats his dinner without entertaining the stranger
who has come to his house quite accidentally, having travelled from a
long distance and is wearied.

<br>

Excessive attachment to sense pleasures leads to bondage, and
detachment from sense pleasures leads to liberation; therefore it is the
mind alone that is responsible for bondage or liberation.

<br>

A brahmana's strength is in his learning, a king's strength is in his
army, a vaishya's strength is in his wealth and a shudra's strength is in
his attitude of service.

<br>

Generosity, pleasing address, courage and propriety of conduct are not
acquired, but are inbred qualities.

<br>

The following four characteristics of the denizens of heaven may be
seen in the residents of this earth planet; charity, sweet words, worship
of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and satisfying the needs of
brahmanas.

<br>

A blade of grass is light, cotton is lighter, the beggar is infinitely lighter
still. Why then does not the wind carry him away? Because it fears that
he may ask alms of him.

<br>

As the man who digs obtains underground water by use of a shovel, so
the student attains the knowledge possessed by his preceptor through
his service.

<br>

There is no disease (so destructive) as lust; no enemy like infatuation;
no fire like wrath; and no happiness like spiritual knowledge.

<br>

Do not inhabit a country where you are not respected, cannot earn your
livelihood, have no friends, or cannot acquire knowledge.

<br>

Sastric knowledge is unlimited, and the arts to be learned are many; the
time we have is short, and our opportunities to learn are beset with
obstacles. Therefore select for learning that which is most important,
just as the swan drinks only the milk in water.

<br>

Mental dirt cannot be washed away even by one-hundred baths in the
sacred waters, just as a wine pot cannot be purified even by evaporating
all the wine by fire.

<br>

A woman does not become holy by offering by charity, by observing
hundreds of fasts, or by sipping sacred water, as by sipping the water
used to wash her husbands feet.

<br>

By going to the den of a lion pearls from the head of an elephant may
be obtained; but by visiting the hole of a jackal nothing but the tail of a
calf or a bit of the hide of an ass may found.

<br>

He whose actions are disorganised has no happiness either in the midst
of men or in a jungle -- in the midst of men his heart burns by social
contacts, and his helplessness burns him in the forest.

<br>

Perhaps nobody has advised Lord Brahma, the creator, to impart
perfume to gold; fruit to the sugarcane; flowers to the sandalwood tree;
wealth to the learned; and long life to the king.

<br>

That thing which is distant, that thing which appears impossible, and
that which is far beyond our reach, can be easily attained through
tapasya (religious austerity), for nothing can surpass austerity.

<br>

Agni is the worshipable person for the twice-born; the brahmana for the
other castes; the husband for the wife; and the guest who comes for
food at the midday meal for all.

<br>

We should not fret for what is past, nor should we be anxious about the
future; men of discernment deal only with the present moment.

<br>

The woman who fasts and observes religious vows without the
permission of her husband shortens his life, and goes to hell.

<br>

Many a bad habit is developed through overindulgence, and many a
good one by chastisement, therefore beat your son as well as your pupil;
never indulge them. ("Spare the rod and spoil the child.")

<br>

He who gives up what is imperishable for that which perishable, loses
that which is imperishable; and doubtlessly loses that which is
perishable also.

<br>

When one is consumed by the sorrows of life, three things give him
relief: offspring, a wife, and the company of the Lord's devotees.

<br>

Rain which falls upon the sea is useless; so is food for one who is
satiated; in vain is a gift for one who is wealthy; and a burning lamp
during the daytime is useless.

<br>

A man is born alone and dies alone; and he experiences the good and
bad consequences of his karma alone; and he goes alone to hell or the
Supreme abode.

<br>

Even a pandit comes to grief by giving instruction to a foolish disciple,
by maintaining a wicked wife, and by excessive familiarity with the
miserable.

<br>

Even from poison extract nectar, wash and take back gold if it has
fallen in filth, receive the highest knowledge (Krsna consciousness)
from a low born person; so also a girl possessing virtuous qualities
(stri-ratna) even if she be born in a disreputable family.

<br>

We should always deal cautiously with fire, water, women, foolish
people, serpents, and members of a royal family; for they may, when
the occasion presents itself, at once bring about our death.

<br>

Though men be endowed with beauty and youth and born in noble
families, yet without education they are like the palasa flower which is
void of sweet fragrance.

<br>

Men have eating, sleeping, fearing and mating in common with the
lower animals. That in which men excel the beasts is discretionary
knowledge; hence, indiscreet men who are without knowledge should
be regarded as beasts.

<br>

Conciliate a strong man by submission, a wicked man by opposition,
and the one whose power is equal to yours by politeness or force.

<br>

A wicked wife, a false friend, a saucy servant and living in a house with
a serpent in it are nothing but death.

<br>

A wicked man may develop saintly qualities in the company of a
devotee, but a devotee does not become impious in the company of a
wicked person. The earth is scented by a flower that falls upon it, but
the flower does not contact the odour of the earth.

<br>

A thing may be dreaded as long as it has not overtaken you, but once it
has come upon you, try to get rid of it without hesitation.

<br>

The scholar who has acquired knowledge by studying innumerable
books without the blessings of a bonafide spiritual master does not
shine in an assembly of truly learned men just as an illegitimate child is
not honoured in society.

<br>

It is better to die than to preserve this life by incurring disgrace. The
loss of life causes but a moment's grief, but disgrace brings grief every
day of one's life.

<br>

There does not exist a ruby in every mountain, nor a pearl in the head of
every elephant; neither are the sadhus to be found everywhere, nor
sandal trees in every forest.

<br>

How can people be made happy in a petty kingdom? What peace can
we expect from a rascal friend? What happiness can we have at home in
the company of a bad wife? How can renown be gained by instructing
an unworthy disciple?

<br>

By preparing a garland for a Deity with one's own hand; by grinding
sandal paste for the Lord with one's own hand; and by writing sacred
texts with one's own hand -- one becomes blessed with opulence equal
to that of Indra.

<br>

Do not pass between two brahmanas, between a brahmana and his
sacrificial fire, between a wife and her husband, a master and his
servant, and a plough and an ox.

<br>

The brahmana who deals in lac-die, articles, oil, indigo, silken cloth,
honey, clarified butter, liquor, and flesh is called a shudra.

<br>

One whose knowledge is confined to books and whose wealth is in the
possession of others, can use neither his knowledge nor wealth when
the need for them arises.

<br>

The house of a childless person is a void, all directions are void to one
who has no relatives, the heart of a fool is also void, but to a poverty
stricken man all is void.

<br>

It is ruinous to be familiar with the king, fire, the religious preceptor,
and a woman. To be altogether indifferent of them is to be deprived of
the opportunity to benefit ourselves, hence our association with them
must be from a safe distance.

<br>

Nothing can reform a bad man, just as the posterious cannot become a
superior part of the body though washed one hundred times.

<br>

Religious austerities should be practiced alone, study by two, and
singing by three. A journey should be undertaken by four, agriculture
by five, and war by many together.

<br>

As you seek fragrance in a flower, oil in the sesamum seed, fire in
wood, ghee in milk, and jaggery (guda) in sugarcane; so seek the spirit
that is in the body by means of discrimination.

<br>

As a whole forest becomes fragrant by the existence of a single tree
with sweet-smelling blossoms in it, so a family becomes famous by the
birth of a virtuous son.

<br>

As night looks delightful when the moon shines, so is a family
gladdened by even one learned and virtuous son.

<br>

The Goddess of wealth is unsteady (chanchala), and so is the life
breath. The duration of life is uncertain, and the place of habitation is
uncertain; but in all this inconsistent world religious merit alone is
immovable.

<br>

For the twice-born the fire (Agni) is a representative of God. The
Supreme Lord resides in the heart of His devotees. Those of average
intelligence (alpa-buddhi or kanista-adhikari) see God only in His sri-
murti, but those of broad vision see the Supreme Lord everywhere.

<br>

The lamp eats up the darkness and therefore it produces lamp black; in
the same way according to the nature of our diet (sattva, rajas, or
tamas) we produce offspring in similar quality.

<br>

The beauty of a cuckoo is in its notes, that of a woman in her unalloyed
devotion to her husband, that of an ugly person in his scholarship, and
that of an ascetic in his forgiveness.

<br>

These five should be considered as mothers; the king's wife, the
preceptor's wife, the friend's wife, your wife's mother, and your own
mother.

<br>

For one whose heart melts with compassion for all creatures; what is
the necessity of knowledge, liberation, matted hair on the head, and
smearing the body with ashes.

<br>

Religion is preserved by wealth; knowledge by diligent practice; a king
by conciliatory words; and a home by a dutiful housewife.

<br>

Give up a member to save a family, a family to save a village, a village
to save a country, and the country to save yourself.

<br>

The student (brahmacari) should completely renounce the following
eight things -- his lust, anger, greed, desire for sweets, sense of
decorating the body, excessive curiosity, excessive sleep, and excessive
endeavour for bodily maintenance.

<br>

He who befriends a man whose conduct is vicious, whose vision
impure, and who is notoriously crooked, is rapidly ruined.

<br>

Those base men who speak of the secret faults of others destroy
themselves like serpents who stray onto anthills.

<br>

He who shall practice twenty virtues shall become invincible in
all his undertakings.

<br>

There are three gems upon this earth; food, water, and pleasing words --
fools (mudhas) consider pieces of rocks as gems.

<br>

Contentment with little or nothing to eat although one may have a great
appetite; to awaken instantly although one may be in a deep slumber;
unflinching devotion to the master; and bravery; these six qualities
should be learned from the dog.

<br>

Learning is retained through putting into practice; family prestige is
maintained through good behaviour; a respectable person is recognised
by his excellent qualities; and anger is seen in the eyes.

<br>

The house in which the lotus feet of brahmanas are not washed, in
which Vedic mantras are not loudly recited, and in which the holy rites
of svaha (sacrificial offerings to the Supreme Lord) and swadha
(offerings to the ancestors) are not performed, is like a crematorium.

<br>

Those who are endowed with beauty and youth and who are born of
noble families are worthless if they have no learning. They are just like
the kimshuka blossoms ( flowers of the palasa tree) which, though
beautiful, have no fragrance.

<br>

Those parents who do not educate their sons are their enemies; for as is
a crane among swans, so are ignorant so are ignorant sons in a public
assembly.

<br>

A man's descent may be discerned by - his conduct, his country by his
pronunciation of language, his friendship by his warmth and glow, and
his capacity to eat by his body.

<br>

At the time of the pralaya (universal destruction) the oceans are to
exceed their limits and seek to change, but a saintly man never changes.

<br>

The learned are envied by the foolish; rich men by the poor; chaste
women by adulteresses; and beautiful ladies by ugly ones.

<br>

If a man should feel before, as he feels after, repentance -- then who
would not attain perfection?

<br>

He who has wealth has friends. He who is wealthy has relatives. The
rich one alone is called a man, and the affluent alone are respected as
pandits.

<br>

The enemy can be overcome by the union of large numbers, just as
grass through its collectiveness wards off erosion caused by heavy
rainfall.

<br>

Brass is polished by ashes; copper is cleaned by tamarind; a woman, by
her menses; and a river by its flow.

<br>

Do not keep company with a fool for as we can see he is a two-legged
beast. Like an unseen thorn he pierces the heart with his sharp words.

<br>

He should be considered to be living who is virtuous and pious, but the
life of a man who is destitute of religion and virtues is void of any
blessing.

<br>

An elephant is controlled by a goad (ankusha), a horse by a slap of the
hand, a horned animal with the show of a stick, and a rascal with a
sword.

<br>

Union in privacy (with one's wife); boldness; storing away useful items;
watchfulness; and not easily trusting others; these five things are to be
learned from a crow.

<br>

Time perfects all living beings as well as kills them; it alone is awake
when all others are asleep. Time is insurmountable.

<br>

That man who by the study of these maxims from the satras acquires a
knowledge of the most celebrated principles of duty, and understands
what ought and what ought not to be followed, and what is good and
what is bad, is most excellent.

<br>

Of what avail is a high birth if a person is destitute of scholarship? A
man who is of low extraction is honoured even by the demigods if he is
learned.

<br>

He who forsakes his own community and joins another perishes as the
king who embraces an unrighteous path.
